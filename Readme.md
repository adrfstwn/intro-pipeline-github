CI/CD, standing for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**, is a DevOps practice that automates and streamlines the software development and deployment lifecycle.

âœ… **Continuous Integration (CI)**
CI is the practice of automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository several times a day. Each integration is verified by automated tests to detect problems early.

Key Concepts:

- Automated tests and code scanning checks.
- Early bug detection.
- Integrate with other tools like SonarCube, Linter, etc.

ðŸš€ **Continuous Delivery (CD)**
CD ensures that code is automatically prepared for a release to production. It builds on CI by automating the release process so that new changes can be deployed at any time with minimal effort.

Key Concepts:

- Automatic deployment to staging.
- Manual or automated release to production.
- Ensures deployment pipeline is always in a releasable state.
