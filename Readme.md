CI/CD, standing for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**, is a DevOps practice that automates and streamlines the software development and deployment lifecycle.

âœ… Continuous Integration (CI)
CI is the practice of automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository several times a day. Each integration is verified by automated tests to detect problems early.

- Key Concepts:
- Frequent commits to the main branch.
- Automated tests and lint checks.
- Early bug detection.
